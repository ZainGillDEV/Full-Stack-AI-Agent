# Frontend guide

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript 7, Tailwind CSS 4,
shadcn/ui (Radix base, new-york style, neutral base colour), lucide-react,
next-themes, react-markdown + remark-gfm, sonner, Geist font via the `geist`
package (self-hosted, no Google Fonts fetch at build time).

## Design language (keep it)

The target look is a calm, professional assistant UI in the spirit of Claude
and ChatGPT, suitable for international clients:

- Neutral grey surfaces (oklch tokens in `app/globals.css`) plus **one** brand
  accent: indigo `--primary` / `--ring`. **No gradients**, no glows, no coloured
  hero sections. The accent is limited to the logo mark, avatars, the send
  button, focus rings, the active chat's left bar and an active thumbs rating.
  Other colour is reserved for state: destructive red, success green dot.
- One content column, `max-w-3xl`, centred. User messages are right-aligned
  rounded bubbles (`bg-secondary`); assistant messages are unboxed prose with a
  small square avatar.
- 15px body text, `leading-7`, Geist Sans; code in Geist Mono.
- Actions appear on hover (always visible on touch devices and on the latest reply).
- Light, dark and system themes with identical layout.
- Mobile: sidebar becomes a left `Sheet`; composer respects the safe-area inset;
  Enter inserts a newline on touch keyboards (send with the button).

## Rebranding

Everything user-visible that names the product lives in `web/lib/config.ts`:

```ts
export const APP_CONFIG = {
  appName: "Assistant",
  appDescription: "AI assistant powered by local and cloud models",
  user: { name: "Zain Ali Gill", subtitle: "Workspace" },   // placeholder until auth
};
```

`scaffold.py --app-name --user-name --description` rewrites these. The API's
display name is `APP_NAME` / `app_name` in `api/app/core/config.py`. Suggestions
on the empty screen are the `SUGGESTIONS` array in `components/chat/empty-state.tsx`.
Brand accent: change `--primary` (and `--ring`, `--sidebar-primary`,
`--sidebar-ring`) in `:root` and `.dark`. Dark mode needs a lighter accent
than light mode so `--primary-foreground` stays readable on it.

## Component map

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `chat-app.tsx` | Owns `useModels` + `useChat`; desktop sidebar collapses with a negative margin and `inert`; shortcuts: Ctrl/⌘+Shift+O new chat, Ctrl/⌘+K search, Esc stop |
| `app-sidebar.tsx` | Date groups (Today / Yesterday / 7 days / 30 days / Older), search across titles and message text, per-chat menu, theme menu, API status dot |
| `model-picker.tsx` | Radio groups: Auto, Local · Ollama (size + params), Cloud sub-menus per provider (scrollable), setup hints when nothing is installed, Refresh |
| `message-list.tsx` | Sticks to bottom only while the user is near it (120 px); floating jump-to-latest button |
| `message.tsx` | Copy, thumbs up/down (toggle), regenerate on last reply, error card with Try again, model badge (local/cloud icon), fallback notice |
| `markdown.tsx` | GFM tables wrapped for horizontal scroll, fenced code with language label + copy, links open in new tab. Memoised |
| `composer.tsx` | `field-sizing-content` auto-grow (max ~13 rows), send ↔ stop toggle, disabled with an explanatory placeholder when no model exists |
| `empty-state.tsx` | Greeting rendered after mount (time-of-day differs server vs client, avoids hydration mismatch) |

## State rules

- All browser-only reads (localStorage, time, matchMedia) happen in effects,
  never during render, so the page prerenders statically without hydration warnings.
- `use-chat` keeps the latest `selection` in a ref, so an in-flight `send`
  always uses the model picked at send time.
- Deleting a chat or clearing all returns an undo function; the UI shows it in
  a sonner toast.
- Only finished messages are persisted (`pending` ones are filtered out).
  Storage is capped at 200 conversations.

## Adding shadcn components

`components.json` is configured (`@/components/ui`, `@/lib/utils`,
`app/globals.css`). On a machine with internet access:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add dialog select avatar
```

If the registry is unreachable (air-gapped / proxied environments), hand-write
the component using the same conventions as the existing ones: `data-slot`
attributes, `cn()` for classes, primitives imported from the unified
`radix-ui` package (`import { Dialog as DialogPrimitive } from "radix-ui"`),
`Slot.Root` for `asChild`.

## Accessibility checklist

- Every icon-only button has `aria-label` (tooltips are not labels).
- The thread is `role="log"` with `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-busy` while streaming.
- Sheet has a visually-hidden `SheetTitle` and `SheetDescription`.
- Focus rings come from shadcn (`focus-visible:ring-[3px]`); don't remove them.
- Collapsed desktop sidebar is `inert` so it's skipped by keyboard and screen readers.
